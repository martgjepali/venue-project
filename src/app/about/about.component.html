        <p class="p-s">Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
          roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000
          years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in
          Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
          Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
          literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
          1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good
          and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
          of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance....

                  The first line of Lorem Ipsum,
                  "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. The
                  standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for
                  those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et
                  Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                  accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
